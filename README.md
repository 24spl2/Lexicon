# Lexicon
Sarah and Dylan's 136 Lab to create a Lexicon

Given an input text file, we explored the functionality of trees. 

The LexiconTrie implements the Lexicon Interface. All the functions based on finding, adding, and replacing are in LexiconTrie. To simplify accessibility, we also have LexiconNode which gives LexiconTrie control over adding children, checking siblings, and removals when accessing a specific node of the Trie.
