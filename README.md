# Lexicon
Sarah and Dylan's 136 Lab to create a Lexicon from input text.

We explored the functionality of trees by forming one big tree, which acts as a dictionary. 

The LexiconTrie implements the Lexicon Interface. All the functions based on finding, adding, and replacing are in LexiconTrie. To simplify accessibility, we also have LexiconNode which gives LexiconTrie control over adding children, checking siblings, and removals when accessing a specific node of the Trie.
